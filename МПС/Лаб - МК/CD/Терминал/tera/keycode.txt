KEYCODE.EXE is a utility which displays the key codes used in the
Tera Term's keyboard setup file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. INSTALLATION

1) Copy KEYCODE.EXE to a directory (folder) of your choice.

2) If you are using Windows 3.1 or Windows NT, install KEYCODE.EXE
in Program Manager with its icon. If you are using Windows 95,
create a shortcut for KEYCODE.EXE in a folder of your choice,
or in the Start menu, or on the desktop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. USAGE

When you run KEYCODE.EXE, the message "Push any key" will be displayed
in the window.  When you press a key or a combination of keys (such as
Ctrl+key), the message "Key code is XXXX." will be displayed. XXXX is a
decimal number.

3. ABOUT THE KEYBOARD SETUP FILE

In the keyboard setup file, you can define certain keys on your keyboard as
VT terminal keys.  You can also define user keys, which will send character
strings of your choice.

The file name of the keyboard setup file can be specified as a command line
parameter of Tera Term (see CMNDLINE.TXT). If you omit the file name extension,
the default extension ".CNF" is used. If you omit the file name, the default
file name "KEYBOARD.CNF" is used. If the specified keyboard setup file does
not exist, the default setup is used.

The default setup is intended for the IBM-PC/AT 101-key keyboard. If you are
using such keyboard and have no need to customize key definitions, you don't
need to make a keyboard setup file.  Otherwise, copy IBMKEYB.CNF to
KEYBOARD.CNF, and edit it.

...............................................................................
3.1 FORMAT OF THE KEYBOARD SETUP FILE

Each key or key combination has a unique key code, which is called
"PC key code". 

The keyboard setup file has five sections:  [VT editor keypad],
[VT numeric keypad], [VT function keys], [Shortcut keys], and [User keys].

1) [VT editor keypad] section
In this section, VT editor keys are assigned to PC keys.

	Format:
		<VT editor key name>=<PC key code>

	where:

	<VT editor key name>
		Up, Down, Right, Left, Find, Insert, Remove, Select,
		Prev, Next

	  <PC key code>
		PC key code (decimal number)

	Example:
		Up=328

2) [VT numeric keypad] section
In this section, VT numeric keys are assigned to PC keys.

	Format:
		<VT numeric key name>=<PC key code>

	where:

	  <VT numeric key name>
		Num0, Num1, Num2, Num3, Num4, Num5, Num6, Num7, Num8,
		Num9, NumMinus, NumComma, NumPeriod, NumEnter, PF1,
		PF2, PF3, PF4

	  <PC key code>
		PC key code (decimal number)

	Example:
		Num0=82

3) [VT function keys] section
In this section, VT function keys are assigned to PC keys.

	Format:
		<VT function key name>=<PC key code>

	where:

	  <VT function key name>
		F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, F12, F13, F14, Help, Do,
		F17, F18, F19, F20

	  <PC key code>
		PC key code (decimal number)

	Example:
		F6=64

4) [Shortcut keys] section
In this section, shortcut keys of Tera Term are assigned to PC keys.

	Format:
		<Shortcut key name>=<PC key code>

	where:
	  <Shortcut key name>	Function
	  --------------------------------------------
	  EditCopy		[Edit] Copy command
	  EditPaste		[Edit] Paste comannd
	  EditPasteCR		[Edit] Paste<CR> command
	  LineUp		Scroll up 1 line
	  LineDown		Scroll down 1 line
	  PageUp		Scroll up 1 page
	  PageDown		Scroll down 1 page
	  BuffTop		Scroll to buffer top
	  BuffBottom		Scroll to buffer bottom
	  SendBreak		[Control] Send break command

	  <PC key code>
		PC key code (decimal number)

	Example:
		LineUp=1352

5) [User keys] section
This section defines user keys and character strings which are sent by
pressing the user keys.

	Format:
		<User key name>=<PC key code>,<Conversion flag>,
				<Character string>

	where:

	  <User key name>
		User1, User2, User3,...., User99
		Maximum number of the user keys is 99. 
		For example, if you want to define ten user keys,
		you must use the first ten names, from "User1" to "User10".

	  <PC key code>
		PC key code (decimal number)

	  <Conversion flag>
		New-line code conversion (CR -> CR/CR+LF) flag
			0	No conversion
			1	New-line codes in the character string
				are converted by Tera Term.

	  <Character string>
		Character string to be sent by pressing the user key.
		Each non-printable character (control character) in
		the string can be expressed as a "$" and ASCII code
		in two-character hex number. For example, CR character
		is expressed as "$0D". "$" itself is expressed as "$24".

	Example:
		User1=59,0,telnet myhost
		User2=60,0,$0D$0A
		User3=61,1,$0D

...............................................................................
3.2 HOW TO DEASSIGN KEYS 

If you don't want to assign a certain VT key or shortcut key to any PC key,
use the word "off" instead of PC key code.

Example:
	EditCopy=off

...............................................................................
3.3 KEY COMBINATIONS

The following key combinations are acceptable to Tera Term and KEYCODE.EXE:

	Shift+key
	Ctrl+key
	Shift+Ctrl+key
	Shift+Alt+key
	Ctrl+Alt+key
	Shift+Ctrl+Alt+key

Since some combinations (such as Alt+key) are used as shortcut keys of
Tera Term and Windows, they don't have PC key codes and can't be specified
in the keyboard setup file.
